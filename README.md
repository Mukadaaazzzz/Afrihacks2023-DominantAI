DominantAI is the Future of Healthcare 

# Dominant AI

Dominant AI is an innovative project focused on harnessing the power of genetic dominance in precision medicine. Leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, Dominant AI aims to decode dominant genetic traits, guiding personalized healthcare interventions and revolutionizing the field of precision medicine.

## Project Overview

At Dominant AI, our primary goal is to explore the influence of dominant genes in healthcare by employing advanced AI algorithms to analyze genetic data. By identifying and understanding dominant genetic markers linked to various health conditions, we aim to pave the way for more accurate and tailored precision medicine solutions.

## Key Features

- **Genomic Analysis**: Utilize AI-driven tools to analyze dominant genetic traits and their impact on health outcomes.
- **Personalized Healthcare**: Tailor treatment plans based on individual genetic predispositions for more effective interventions.
- **Predictive Insights**: Predict disease susceptibilities and genetic predispositions for better health management.
